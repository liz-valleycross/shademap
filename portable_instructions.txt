TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

"Server not found" error:
→ Download caddy.exe or install Python

Port 8000 already in use:
→ Close other programs using port 8000
→ Or modify start_server.bat to use port 8080

Can't find address:
→ Use full address including zip code
→ Example: "123 Main St, Orlando, FL 32801"

Map not loading:
→ Check internet connection
→ Libraries load from CDN, need internet

Analysis not working:
→ Verify Shadow Map API key is correct
→ Make sure parking lot is drawn
→ Check that dates are valid

Libraries not loading:
→ Check internet connection
→ Try different browser (Chrome recommended)


FILE SIZES FOR DISTRIBUTION:
=============================
- sun_exposure_map.html: ~50KB
- caddy.exe: ~15MB
- start_server.bat: 2KB
- instructions.txt: 5KB

Total ZIP size: ~15MB


WHY LOCALHOST IS REQUIRED:
==========================
The app uses:
- External JavaScript libraries (Leaflet, etc.)
- Advanced browser APIs
- Cross-origin requests

These require proper HTTP server (localhost) and won't work
when opened directly as file:// in browser.
